# **CDN-Content Delivery Networks**

- A content delivery network, or CDN, is a distributed server network that delivers temporarily stored, or cached, copies of website content to users, based on the user's geographic location

- A CDN stores this content in distributed locations and reduces the distance between your website visitors, and your website server

- The further you're away, the longer it takes ultimately, the slower the website will be for you
 
- This is how CDN actually accomplishes the increase in speed, which is by reducing the amount of distance between the user and the content, or the server providing the content. It places these content delivery network endpoints in as many locations around the world as possible
