# **Cloud Security**



- Cloud security refers to the policies, technological procedures, services, and solutions designed to secure the enterprise applications and data on cloud against insider threats, data breaches, compliance issues, and organized security threats (is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the user organization)



- Platform as a service (PaaS) as an example, 
  - you're **building applications**, **migrating data** to the cloud, and building applications, **running them on the cloud**
 
  - So you're responsible for **securing the applications, the workload, and the data**, while the cloud provider is responsible for **managing the security of the platform**,  it's secured from **the perspective of network, the platform on down**, in terms of managing the containers, the runtime, and isolation so that you have your own space within the platform
 
- it's very important to understand the adoption model
 
- if you're consuming SaaS, 
  - The cloud provider manages all the applications, and the security of it
 
  - you worry about the data that you bring in, and plan accordingly



- When you build applications and migrate applications, or modernize your apps - let's start with data:
  - Is it confidential data? Is it public data or sensitive data, that may deal with private information? Consider all those factors and make a secure design around what your data security architecture should be
 
  - Make sure you have data at rest encryption so that the data is always encrypted
 
  - you can actually start to protect data using hardware based technologies where you can protect in-memory data as well
 
  - Make sure you exactly know which applications need to access, or which users need to access the data to run your cloud applications



- Identity and Access Management known as access control, works as the first line of defense, allowing you to authenticate and authorize users and provide user-specific access to cloud resources, services, and applications
 
- A comprehensive security strategy needs to encompass the security needs of a wide audience including:
  - organizational users, 
  - internet and social-based users, 
  - third-party business partner organizations and vendors

**There are three main types of users:**
  - **Administrative Users** (cloud platform administrators, operators, and managers)
