# **Public Cloud**

- Public cloud không giới hạn đối tượng sử dụng, đó có thể là bất cứ ai từ cá nhân cho đến doanh nghiệp
 
- Nhà cung cấp tạo ra các tài nguyên như máy ảo, ứng dụng hoặc bộ nhớ có sẵn cho khách hàng sử dụng trên internet (office 365 hay gmail, google drive,… )



- In a public cloud model, users get access to servers, storage, network, security, and applications as services delivered by cloud service providers over the internet
 
- Users don’t own the servers their applications run on or storage their data consumes, or manage the operations of the servers, or even determine how the platforms are maintained. (the same way that we consume and pay for utilities such as water, electricity, or gas in our everyday lives, we don’t own any of these cloud resources—we make an agreement with the service provider, use the resources, and pay for what we use within a certain period)



- The provider bears all the capital, operational, and maintenance expenses for the infrastructure and the facilities they are hosted in
 
- A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling tenants or users to share computing resources, residing outside their firewalls
 
- **Some use cases for Public Cloud:**
  - reducing time-to-market for products and services
  - disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity
