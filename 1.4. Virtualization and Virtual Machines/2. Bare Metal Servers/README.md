# **Bare Metal Servers**

- A bare metal server is a single-tenant, dedicated physical server. In other words, it's dedicated to a single customer. The cloud provider actually takes the physical server and plugs it into a rack in a data center for customers
 
 
- The cloud provider manages the server up to the operating system or OS, which means if anything goes wrong with the hardware or rack connection, they will fix or replace it and then reboot the server
 
 
- The customer is responsible for administering and managing everything else on the server
 
 
- Bare metal servers are physical machines, they take longer to provision than virtual servers
 
 
- Bare Metal servers are dedicated for use by a single client at any given time (more expensive)
 
 
- Bare metal servers are fully customizable, they can do what a customer wants in the most demanding environments
 
 
- Bare metal servers are dedicated and intended for long term, high performance use in highly secure and isolated environments. Clients have full access and control of bare metal servers because there’s no hypervisor required, no sharing underlying server hardware with other customers
