# **Cloud Infrastructure**


- After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type offered by vendors, customers need to plan the infrastructure architecture. The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud.



- This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data Centers. A Cloud provider’s IT environment is typically distributed across many regions around the world. 
 
- A cloud region, is a geographic area or location where a cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered 
 
- The isolation of zones improves the cloud’s overall fault tolerance, decreases latency, and avoids creating a single shared point of failure
 
- Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers or virtual machines (also called VMs for short), that are software-based computers, based on virtualization technologies. 



- Computing Resources: Cloud providers offer several compute options – Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and “Serverless” computing resources:
