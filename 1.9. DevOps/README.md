# **DevOps**


- Development teams need to design, develop, deliver and run software as reliably and efficiently as possible
 
- Operations teams need to identify and resolve problems as soon as possible by monitoring, predicting failure, managing the environment, and fixing issues

- Combining development and operations with the ability to monitor and analyze and optimize bottlenecks gives us DevOps, a collaborative approach where business owners and the development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software
 
- A DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders in an organization who develop, operate, or benefit from the business’s software systems, including customers, suppliers, partners.

- Continuous Delivery: delivering small, well-designed, high-quality, increments of software to customers
 
- Continuous Integration; creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable images; where immutable implies that when modifications are needed, the entire component is replaced with an upgraded version
 
- Continuous Deployment, which involves progressing each new packaged build through the deployment lifecycle as rapidly as possible.
 
- Continuous Monitoring; with tools that help developers understand the performance and availability of their applications, even before they are deployed to production
 
- Delivery Pipeline; which is an automated sequence of steps that involves the stages of Ideation, Coding, Building, Deploying, Managing, and Continuous Improvement; which loops back to the Ideation phase in the delivery pipeline
