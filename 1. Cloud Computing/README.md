# **Cloud Computing**

- **Cloud Computing:**
  - a model for enabling convenient
  - on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources
  - can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction



- **Examples of computing resources:**

- Caas (Cloud Computing as a Service)
 
- **3 types of cloud** deployment models:
  - Public: leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
 
  - Private: the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.
 
  - Hybrid: combines public cloud and private cloud environments by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This helps businesses seamlessly scale services back and forth between their own infrastructure and the public cloud. Lets users use multiple cloud models working together seamlessly



- **2 cloud benefits that make it lower-risk for enterprises to adopt cloud:**
  - The pay-as-you-go model allows enterprises to experiment with technologies as opposed to making long-term decisions based on little or no trial



  - The speed with which applications can be up and running on the cloud versus months on traditional platforms, means enterprises can experiment, fail fast, learn, and course correct without setting them back significantly.



- **Three-way symbiotic relationship between blockchain, IoT, AI, and Cloud:**
  - IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both emerging technologies leverage cloud's scalability and processing power
 
  - Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies.
